Adjunct,Briess,Barley Flakes,"Use Barley Flakes as an adjunct in all-grain brews to produce a lighter colored finished beer without lowering the original gravity. Use in place of corn as an adjunct to eliminate corn flavor in the finished beer. Use at 10-25% of total grist to produce a light colored, mild flavored, dry beer.",1.4
Adjunct,Briess,Yellow Corn Flakes,"Produced from yellow corn that has had the germ, oil and most of the protein removed, Yellow Corn Flakes produce a beer with a mild, less malty flavor and body than an all-malt beer. Yellow Corn Flakes also produce a drier, more crisp beer. Use up to 40% as a cereal adjunct in the total mash. Since the corn is de-germed, most of the oil is removed. This can cause lack of foam which is characteristic of high adjunct beers. Unlike corn grits which must be liquefied in a cereal cooker, Yellow Corn Flakes can be added directly to the mash. Do not mill. A single or multiple temperature infusion can be used. Conversion time and lautering time will be normal.
Flavor: Corn",0.8
Adjunct,Briess,Oat Flakes,"Made from dehulled oats, Oat Flakes are readily attacked by malt enzymes although brewhouse yield may be slightly lower than with any of the other pregelatinized flakes. Oat Flakes have a very distinctive ""sticky"" mouthfeel, noticeable even when used in small increments. Use 5-25% for an Oatmeal Stout. A small percentage of Oat Flakes is nice in Belgian-style White Beers. Oat Flakes tend to make a sticky mash. The more used, the stickier the mash. To counteract this, add more foundation water. Use a ratio of 3.0 to 3.2 parts of water to 1 part grist. The run-off from the lauter will remain rather milky, but clears during filtration.
Flavor: Oat",2.5
Adjunct,Briess,Rice Flakes,"Produced from medium-grain rice, Rice Flakes will help you brew light, clean and crisp beers. Rice Flakes can be used up to 40% of the total grist. We suggest using slightly lower conversion temperatures and extending the conversion time by 15 minutes to obtain maximum efficiency.
Flavor: None",1
Adjunct,Briess,Red Wheat Flakes,"Produced from high quality wheat with acceptable protein level. Use in place of Malted Wheat in wheat beers. Flakes will yield a different flavor profile than Malted Wheat. Red Wheat Flakes are recommended for Belgian-style White Beers. A maximum of 40% of the total grist is recommended. A small amount of Red Wheat Flakes, 0.5-1.0%, added to a standard brew will greatly increase the foam stability due to the type of protein that wheat contributes.
Flavor: Wheat",2
Adjunct,Briess,Rye Flakes,"Rye Flakes contribute a very clean, distinctive rye flavor. Start at 5-10% and increase in increments of 5% because of the concentrated, distinctive flavor of Rye Use up to 40% as a cereal adjunct in the total grist to create Rye Beer. Flakes will exhibit a sticky mash, however, not to the extent of Oat Flakes. Use your judgment when deciding to add more water to help avoid a sticky mash.
Flavor: Rye",3
Adjunct,Briess,Torrified Wheat,"Part of our Insta Grains® product, line Torrified Wheat is short for Insta Grains® Soft Red Wheat Whole Kernel. That's what you'll see printed on the label, but don't worry. It's simply Torrified Wheat. Our Torrified Wheat has been heat treated to break the cellular structure, allowing for rapid hydration and malt enzymes to more completely attack the starches and protein.
